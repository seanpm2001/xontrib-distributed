Importantly this provides a substitute 'dworker' command
which enables distributed workers to have access to xonsh builtins.

Furthermore, this xontrib adds a 'DSubmitter' context manager
for executing a block remotely.
Moreover, this also adds a convenience function 'dsubmit()'
for creating DSubmitter and Executor instances at the same time.

Thus users may submit distributed jobs with::

```pycon
with dsubmit('127.0.0.1:8786', rtn='x') as dsub:
    x = $(echo I am elsewhere)
res = dsub.future.result()
print(res)
```

This is useful for long running or non-blocking jobs.
